                <p class="para">I hope that after some time, I can get to a point where I can work freelance helping businesses build their presence on the web or designing websites for them in general. It has been a goal of mine for a while to eventually become my own boss, dictating my own work schedule (more or less). I know that working freelance can be a challenging thing, but i believe i can be successful doing so and I would really like to someday be able to say that I work for myself.</p>
