                <p class="para">I was born in West, Texas and have lived most of my life in the Dallas area. I graduated from South Garland High School in 2009 and enrolled into Richland Community College afterwards. After 2 years at Richland, I transfered to The University of Texas at Arlingtion where I began studying Architecture. I spent another 2 years there before I transfered over to UT Dallas, switching majors and graduating with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>
                <p class="para">I have worked mostly in the retail field, which includes a job as a Sales Merchandiser for a merchandising company based out of Plano, Texas. I'm currently looking for opertunities in a new field, in particular the tech field, where the future seems to be heading.</p>
                <p class="para">I'm currently attending school for web design and hope to have a job doing that by the time I get done with schooling. I hope that after some time, I can get to a point where I can work freelance helping businesses build their presence on the web or designing websites for them in general. It has been a goal of mine for a while to eventually become my own boss, dictating my own work schedule (more or less). I know that working freelance can be a challenging thing, but i believe i can be successful doing so and I would really like to someday be able to say that I work for myself.</p>
